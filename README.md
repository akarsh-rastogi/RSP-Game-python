**Description:** 
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible outcomes are:

Rock (a fist)
Paper (an open hand)
Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)
The rules are simple:

Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
In this project, you'll create a Python program that allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The program will randomly generate the computer's choice and compare it to the user's input to determine the winner. The game will continue until the user decides to quit.
